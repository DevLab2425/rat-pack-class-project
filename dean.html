<H1>Dean Martin</H1>
1917-1995
<P>
Actor, 
singer; born Dino Paul Crocetti, in Steubenville, Ohio on June 7, 1917, the younger 
of two sons born of Italian immigrants. Had one brother, Bill. 
<P> Best known for his comedic partnership with Jerry Lewis, as well as for his 
participation in the "Rat Pack," a group of entertainers-including Frank Sinatra, 
Sammy Davis, Jr., Joey Bishop, and Peter Lawford-who performed together in Las 
Vegas and teamed up in several films in the early 1960s. 
<P> Martin attended Grant Elementary School in Steubenville, Ohio, and took up 
the drums as a hobby as a teenager. After dropping out of Steubenville High School 
in the tenth grade, he worked odd jobs, including part-time as an amateur welterweight 
boxer under the name "Kid Crochet." Martin also dabbled in illegal activities, 
including driving liquor across state lines during prohibition, selling lottery 
tickets, acting as a bookie, and working as a card dealer and croupier in local 
gambling joints. 
<P> Martin began his show business career at age seventeen, singing in Ohio nightclubs 
near his hometown. During a stint with the Ernie McKay band, he was noticed by 
Cleveland bandleader Sammy Watkins, who hired him as the band’s featured vocalist. 
He began touring with Watkins in 1938, and in 1940, changed his name to Dean Martin. 
In September 1943, Martin signed an exclusive contract with MCA to sing at the 
Riobamba Room in New York, and in 1944 he was given his own fifteen-minute radio 
program broadcasting from New York City, Songs by Dean Martin. In 1946 he signed 
a contract and recorded four songs with Diamond Records. 
<P> During a club engagement in 1946, Martin met Jerry Lewis and the two began 
joking around with each other during their respective acts. They teamed up in 
1947, with Martin playing the straight man to Lewis's clown. NBC broadcast a regular 
thirty-minute radio program featuring the pair in 1949, and they made their television 
debut in the Colgate Comedy Hour in 1950. The immensely popular Martin and Lewis 
team made sixteen films together between 1949 and 1956. 
<P> <img src="deanpic2.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" width="182" height="230" alt="Picture of Dean">Martin 
and Lewis last performed together at the Copacabana in New York, on July 24, 1956. 
After ten years as a team, they split up due to creative differences. Martin struck 
out on his own and resumed his singing career, recording such hit records for 
Capitol as "That's Amore," "Memories are Made of This," "When You're Smiling," 
and "Oh Marie." He also resumed acting in films, and in 1958, Martin received 
critical acclaim after appearing with Montgomery Clift and Marlon Brando in The 
Young Lions. 
<P> It was around this time 
that Martin began performing in Las Vegas with a group of close friends who were 
members of a Hollywood clique known as "The Rat Pack." The group, which included 
Martin, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr., Joey Bishop, and Peter Lawford, soon 
branched out from Vegas to the movies. They starred as an ensemble cast in the 
caper film Ocean's Eleven (1960), followed by Sergeants Three (1962) and Robin 
and the Seven Hoods (1964). 
<P> Martin appeared in a total 
of fifty-one films in his lifetime, including Some Came Running (1958) with Shirley 
MacLaine and Frank Sinatra, Bells Are Ringing (1960) with Judy Holliday, Rio Bravo 
(1959) with John Wayne, Toys in the Attic, (1963), Airport (1970), Cannonball 
Run (1981) and Cannonball Run II (1984). 
<P> In 1962, Martin left Capitol 
Records and signed with Reprise. In 1964, he recorded his blockbuster hit, "Everybody 
Loves Somebody," which beat the Beatles to become the No. 1 hit in America for 
one week. It became the theme song for his television variety series, The Dean 
Martin Show, which ran on NBC for eight years starting in 1965. Martin followed 
this with The Dean Martin Comedy Hour, which ran from 1973 to 1974. An indelible 
part of Martin's television "schtick" was his comedic portrayal of life as an 
alcoholic lush, which many people never realized was just an act. 
<P> <img src="deanpic3.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" width="132" height="131" alt="Picture of Dean">Martin 
was married three times, first to wife Elizabeth Anne McDonald on October 2, 1941. 
The couple had four children: Stephen (Craig), born June 29, 1942; Claudia, born 
March 16, 1944; Barbara (Gail), born April 11, 1945; and Deana (Dina), born August 
19, 1948. He married second wife Jeanne Biegger on September 1, 1949 and had three 
children: Dino Paul Jr., born November 17, 1951; Ricci James, born September 20, 
1953; and Gina Caroline, born December 20, 1956. In 1973, Martin married third 
wife Catherine Mae Hawn, and adopted a daughter Sasha. Their marriage ended in 
1976.<P>Martin suffered a tragic 
loss when his son, Dino Jr., was killed in a plane crash during a military training 
exercise in 1987. He retired from show business after a 1988-89 concert tour with 
fellow rat-packers Sammy Davis, Jr. and Frank Sinatra, which ended for Martin 
after he became ill and was replaced by Liza Minelli for the remainder of the 
tour. Martin died of acute respiratory failure in Beverly Hills on December 25, 
1995.
